    <h1>A Generating Geometry</h1>
    <p>
    Le Corbusier claimed that all the great buildings could be
    reconstructed from their plans. (He was thinking mostly of his own
    buildings, but he often used a few classic Greek temples for examples.)
    You can ascertain the proportioning system that the architects were
    employing, and so you can figure out the height of the spaces from the
    plan. You know the materials from the footprint (a block of marble
    looks like <em>this</em>, a steel column is like <em>that</em>), and
    you know how how much weight a specific material can hold so you can
    start to figure out what sort of loads were carried by this plan. He
    might have been exaggerating to make a point, but his point was that if
    the design was very honest, the volumes (and therefore the building
    itself) would be contained in information in the plan.
    </p>
    <p>
    That seems correct, appropriate, and a good goal for a building's
    design.
    </p>
    <p>
    So we start from the plan. We usually already have some sectional
    ideas, some ideas about space, spatial vignettes we are interested in,
    and ideas about the programmatic requirements of the building, but the
    plan is where we start putting our ideas together, connecting them.
    </p>

    Frank Lloyd Wright felt that the site was where the inspiration lay, so
    <em>he</em> started by first looking at sections through the site and
    features of the site that were in plan. We saw a sketch for the last
    Wright house that he was involved in (just before his death) when we
    were at the Wright archives in Scottsdale. It was a topographical
    map and he had just sketched some circles with a soft pencil in loopy
    configurations following a ridge that was apparent in the topography.
    So that was where he started: soft shapes (circles) march in plan along
    a topographical feature (ridge) on the site. He took ill the next day
    and died in a week or so, but his disciples faithfully followed that
    little sketch and created another Wright house.
    </p>
    <p>
    Back to the plan: so if you are looking at the plan, and you start
    laying down some ideas about the sequence of spaces (our own obsession
    is often connected to sequence and rhythm), where do you start? Mies
    liked a grid. Corbusier liked some orthogonal lines that he called
    regulating lines: often a grid, but often an irregular one with a
    rhythm like a-b-a-b-c (Mies was stricter about his grids: a-a-a-a-a).
    </p>
    <p>
    Usually, the site is more interesting than simply an orthogonal grid.
    The movement of the sun is of particular importance to us (it is the
    light that creates the experience of the forms built), and so are the
    relation of prominent landmarks to the site. So, for instance, the
    Strip is twenty-eight degrees east of north from the Slammer's site.
    Coincidentally (or perhaps not) the original house was oriented in
    that direction. So the rest of
    <a href="../projects/199601.html">The Slammer</a>
    meanders south (to get away from the road, to watch the mountains, to
    form the courtyard) and while it does so, it steps through those
    twenty-eight degrees back towards the north south grid (important to
    the site because it is how the Vegas basin has been etched by the BLM),
    making a set of seven degree steps. Those same steps allow the building
    to bend a little this way and that to make the courtyard both a little
    more intimate and a little more animated than it would be otherwise,
    and to present a little more imposing face to visitors (a little more
    aggressive stance in plan). Because that set of rotations starts to
    affect the cubic volumes we were creating for the programmatic spaces
    of the house, the house has some more drama, some more movement, than
    it would otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
    The idea which informs those design decisions is <em>a generating
    geometry.</em> If you saw some of the earliest drawings for the Slammer
    you would see idealized plans of the courtyard and driveway, sweeping
    arcs of circles that represented "public" and "private" faces
    (experiences) of the building. As the generating geometry is added to
    the mix, and starts to be expressed in the built form, it works off
    these ideals and that tension creates some of the drama that you feel
    at The Slammer and in
