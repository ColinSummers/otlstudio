    <h1>Plan Obsession</h1>
    <p>
    Unless there has been some accident or misfortune, you have two eyes in
    your head, set on a line perpendicular to gravity, a certain distance
    apart. They allow you to perceive depth. We have worked for the
    smallest giant (someone 6'6" or taller is technically a giant), but
    most people experience architecture for a pretty narrow range of
    heights.
    </p>
    <p>
    If you stand at a point at the entry to a courtyard and if we draw an
    arc fifty feet out from that point and place ten columns along that
    arc, you will stop right at that point. Your primordial brain will tell
    you that all the columns are equidistant and, we're not sure why, you
    pause to reflect on this little pattern recognition trick.
    </p>
    <p>
    You look out the window while doing dishes in the little sink in
    <a href="../projects/199601.html">The Slammer</a>
    kitchen and the edges of the big red structural fins all line up and
    point right at the center of the door from the garage. You remember how
    you walked in last night, right through that door. Somehow, this etches
    something (a plan, an experience, a sequence, a collection of episodes)
    in your mind. It happens in a flash. You are helpless, it happens in an
    instant and probably has something to do with keeping track of
    migrating herds that you needed to hunt on the plains a while back.
    </p>
    <p>
    Place. Path. Distance.
    </p>
    <p>
    We can record, or dictate, a vast amount of it and orchestrate a
    stunning amount just in a plan. That's where we can see the
    largest portion of the building at a single time. Most importantly (to
    us), we can see sequences, episodes as someone will move
    through the spaces. You will see this, you turn, that's a center
    (click), you turn, it's dark here and light over there (click), and you
    are drawn along, or stopped, or your perception is strobed as you
    walk along the catwalk and you glance at the sun on the
    mountains in the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
    All that is in the plan.
    </p>
    <p>
    So it is easy to become obsessed with the plan. And dangerous,
    because in the end the building is an object, a series of faces, a set
    of volumes, a collection of verticals and horizontals which might
    not come across exactly the same in plan as they do in model, or
    in a tiny thumbnail perspective.
    </p>
    <p>
    So we discuss constantly how to stay out of the plan, how to keep
    swapping back and forth from the plan to little sections, looking at
    what else was seen, up and down, rather than just on the hypnotic
    horizontal plain from a single (albeit moving) point. The computer
    has been a huge improvement in facilitating this early in the
    process.
