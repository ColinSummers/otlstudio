    In 1999 Colin started work with <a href="http://deancameron.com" target="_blank">Dean</a>
    to bring the technology of <a href="jungle.html">The Jungle</a> to a
    wider audience.
    </p>
    <p>
    In less than three months the web service was up and running. After
    several years of suspense, the technology, software and business
    model received
    <a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=6,816,884.PN.&amp;OS=PN/6,816,884&amp;RS=PN/6,816,884">a patent</a>
    from the United States Patent Office.
    </p>
    <p>
    It went through various re-designs, but the operation of the site
    remained very consistent over the six years it was in operation. In
    the last few years it went to a subscription model and it actually
    ran in the black, a rare condition in the dot-com era. Although there
    was a peak of over twenty thousand registered users, in the end
    there were about four hundred active tightcircles and five thousand users.
    </p>
    <p>
    The tightcircle technology would eventually be re-launched as the
    <a href="http://closebunch.com">closebunch.com</a> web service, which is
    cleverly crafted by Colin to evade the very patent he was awarded.
    </p>
    <p>
    One of the pages explained to new visitors what a tightcircle was:
    </p>

    <div class="quote">
    If you like email, you are going to love tightcircle.
    <p>
    A tightcircle is a place where a group of people can stay in touch
    online. Ongoing, online contact. It is like a conference call in email.
    </p>
    <p>
    Even if you have just started using email, you can use tightcircle. It
    is so simple.
    </p>
    <p>
    Just like regular email correspondence, each member can send messages
    into the tightcircle whenever they please. If you're a night owl and you
    normally check email at 3am, you can send messages while Aunt Valda
    is sleeping. Then, when she's up with the sun, she can reply, and the
    whole conversation is captured in the digest Cousin Sam reads when he
    gets to work at 9am.
    </p>
    <p>
    A tightcircle is a group conversation that takes place in email. Better
    than a simple correspondence, the conversation can include more than two
    people at a time. This doesn't happen real time, like an online chat or
    instant message session, but in email, which you can collect, read and
    reply to at your convenience. Because email messages from the various
    members are grouped together into one digest, there is a feeling of
    continuity, community and a conversational thread.
    </p>
    <p>
    Just get a group together &mdash; whether it's your college buddies, your
    siblings, your work mates, or your bridge club. Anyone who is on a
    computer and has access to email can be in a tightcircle that you
    create.
    </p>
    <p>
    You can create as many tightcircles as you want.
    </p>
    <p>
    The beauty of a tightcircle is that it is as easy as sending an email
    message, only instead of going to one person, it is read by every member
    of the tightcircle. Those messages are collected, digested, sent out at
    regular intervals by the secret tightcircle mechanism, and voila! the
    digests arrive in your inbox as email.
    </p>
    <p>
    You can even tell the tightcircle how often you want digests delivered.
    Some people check email three times a day, while others are lucky to
    log-on once a week. Just set the frequency and your digests will roll in
    as often or seldom as you like.
