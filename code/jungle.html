    In March 1987 Colin created The Jungle, an electronic community for
    Penn &amp; Teller. It was a electronic mail center, handling private
    messages as well as public discussion messages. He wrote it in
    Turbo Pascal 3.0, and ran it on an IBM PC XT/286. The Jungle replaced the
    electronic mail program that was included with PC Remote, software
    published by DCA, the makers of CrossTalk.
    </p>
    <p>
    Over time an offline reader was added to the package, and in the early
    nineties the public discussion messages were set up to be digested and
    sent out to some participants in regular Internet mail. When it became
    clear that there were better mail clients and mail solutions, the
    Jungle's original software was shut down, and the public discussion
    ran briefly on some C++ code. That was short lived. It broke too much
    and Colin wasn't involved enough in the architecture of the solution.
    </p>
    <p>
    So Colin created the entire system again, this time with Claris
    Emailer, Apple's own HyperCard, and a couple of little AppleScripts
    that connected the two. It has handled tens of thousands of messages
    in the current configuration, which has run since 1997
    with few changes. It runs on an Apple iMac, a fruit-colored one
    from the old days, running the MacOS version 8.1. It is fed
    bandwidth by FIOS in a little room off a garage.
    </p>
    <p>
    The total code for the HyperCard portion of the solution is less than
    100k of HyperTalk scripts. HyperTalk is a beautiful message-centric
    object-oriented language.
    </p>
    <p>
    Eventually the idea of The Jungle went public with
    <a href="tightcircle.html">tightcircle</a>, technology which resulted
    in a

    being issued to Colin.
