	<p>
	Tom and Burt Bramlett moved from New Jersey to Las Vegas with
	the Penn & Teller show. Since we were often around the offices
	during the design of <a href="199601.html">The Slammer</a> we
	talked with them about a home they wanted to build in the
	desert.
	<p>
	The site was flat and featureless. There was no neighborhood.
	Tom already had most of the house planned, so we worked on how
	to best implement it and added some double-story spaces. The
	house was to be constructed of split-faced concrete block with a
	wood framed interior.
	<p>
	Ultimately, the construction costs in Las Vegas were climbing
	too quickly and it made more sense for the Bramlett's to buy an
	existing house.
