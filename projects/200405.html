	<p>
	In the original sketches for 
	<a href="199601.html">The Slammer</a>
	the client's office was isolated in the center of the courtyard in a
	single room perched on a tower of skeletal steel. Budget
	constraints removed the tower from the courtyard, which was
	unfortunate because the client really identified with the form. The
	isolation he appreciated in the tower design was accomplished by
	having his office space separated from the rest of the residence so
	that it was reached via a walk along the exterior catwalk and up a
	set of exterior stairs. The office was on top of the band room, and
	formed a tower that was one half of the entry pylons for the
	courtyard.
	<p>
	Once Mr. Jillette moved to Las Vegas permanently 
	(see <a href="200401.html">The Slammer: Vintage Nudes Studio</a>)
	and started a family 
	(see <a href="200404.html">The Slammer: Cellblock B</a>)
	a writing space with some more isolation was desired. After some
	examination of possible locations we determined that we would
	get the most mileage out of this new structure by placing it over the
	driveway. This meant that we would have an easy path from the
	original office, which would become a research and meeting
	space. For the first time, we would put an occupied space into the
	portion of the site east of the main line of spaces which run south
	from the cylindrical stair space (our hinge).  We discovered that
	this "activated" the large area we had originally turned over to
	vehicles and arriving visitors. Since the client had recently
	acquired another two and a half acre residential lot to the east,
	we felt this was a logical direction to extend the "reach" of the
	home.
	<p>
	The original tower in 1995 was more fire lookout and the final
	design is much more modern. The steel structure that supports the
	office is still steel with some x-bracing, but it is square tubes rather
	than the angle pieces that would be used in the Forest Service. The
	spindly sort of construction which we are sometimes aesthetically
	attracted to is often in direct conflict with sensible engineering
	and, more importantly, local building codes.
	<p>
	The office is a cube, encased in baked enamel steel panels. To
	write, Mr. Jillette only needs a chair, a keyboard and a screen.
	There are a few creature comforts we added (a drink holder, a
	foot rest), but in general his solitary form rotating in a comfortable
	chair generated the space. The writing space was then revealed
	as a cylinder of dark glass seen where the cube is stripped away.
	<p>
	The tower serves as a point of observation for visitors arriving on
	the site, and even family members returning home. There is a
	small circle of glass in the floor and as a car drives home it will
	pass right under Mr. Jillette's feet. Obviously, the tower is also an
	identifying piece of the continuing composition that is
