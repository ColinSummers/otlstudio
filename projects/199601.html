	<p>
	The primary residence for Penn Jillette in Las Vegas was a 2,500
	square foot addition to an existing 1,500 square foot house. We
	joined our new architecture to the old using a cylindrical stair tower
	as a hinge point.
	<p>
	The residence which we completed for Penn Jillette in 1996 was,
	ultimately, a  very successful design for the way he occupied the
	house. Rarely a week went by during the first two years that we
	didn't receive an email message from him praising one aspect of
	the design or another. His comedy and magic show toured the
	country and each time he returned home he discovered the
	charms of the house anew.
	<p>
	The general scheme of the building is a single layer of spaces
	wrapped around a courtyard (which is treated as a large outdoor
	room, rather than separated as an exterior space). The outside of
	the house is prison-like and the courtyard interior is defined by a
	series of brightly-colored stucco walls and, at night, neon-like
	lighting. The courtyard is a microcosm of the Strip. Mr. Jillette
	refers to the house with a prison name, and as the project was
	under way called it Prison and Paradise saying, "You don't want to
	knock on the door, but once you are inside you never want to
	leave."
	<p>
	In the seven years since it was completed the house has been on
	over a dozen home shows. Soon after its completion it won the
	following awards:
	<ul>
		<li>1996 AIA Las Vegas Award 
		<li>1996 AIA Las Vegas Student's Choice Award 
		<li>1997 AIA Nevada Student's Choice Award 
		</ul>
		<p>
		Every artist in search of freedom needs a great patron. Mr. Jillette
		is ours. In the decade since he first purchased his "crazy A-frame
		in the desert," we have continued to add to it. It is represented in
		our portfolio in the following projects:

		Key to our success there in the southeast corner of the Las Vegas
		basin is Mr. Jillette's willingness to collaborate. The very parable
		that generated the original design was something he offered
		during dinner. While we were selecting colors for the original
		interior he was quick to pick some startling bold colors which
		have certainly contributed to the visibility and memorability of the
		house ("I'm attracting to bright colors, like a parakeet"). His
		courage to allow us to work impeded and his trust that our
		finished product would provide the functions that he outlined at
		the start of each project meant that we have created things far
		outside the normal envelope of residential design. This is
		appropriate for someone who has, in general, lived outside usual
		definitions.
		<p>
		When we began working on the Slammer it was an odd structure
		to find in the middle of the desert: a chalet with a steep a-frame
		roof. In 1994 the street running past the house had only recently
		been paved and there were only a few other houses on in. A
		dozen years later the street is crowded with houses and even has
		the entrance to a housing development on it. But when we first
		walked the site with Mr. Jillette you could see the lights of The Strip
		glittering a few miles away. Studying a map of the city we realized
		that the original house, most likely through coincidence, pointed
		directly at The Strip and that the angle of the original Las Vegas
		Blvd. The house sat on a road which, like nearly all the original
		roads in Las Vegas, was on a strict compass grid. We
		incorporated this grid shift (and increments of it) into our plan for
		the original addition. (See [Generating Geometry] and the related
		[Plan Obsession] for more explanation.)
		<p>
		The cylindrical tower marks the hinge-point of the old and new
		structures. The driveway brings arrivals onto the site from the
		corner and draws them along a center line of the cylinder and
		then slips them south along the length of the new building.
		<p>
		A seventy foot long lap pool in the courtyard allowed us to start
		developing a strong secondary axis on the western edge of the
		courtyard. This is continued with a lines of fruit and nut bearing
		trees and, to the south, (originally) there was a ramp of soil (from
		the excavation of the pool). This ramp was as long as the pool and
		rose from the floor of the desert up to the height of our client (six
		foot six inches).
		<p>
		Mr. Jillette wanted to be able to have overnight guests stay at the
		house without having them worry about interrupting his unusual
		schedule (when he is performing he doesn't get to bed until the
		early hours of the morning). After experimenting on the existing
		house (having him walk on the front porch for two laps if he was
		going from the bedroom to the kitchen for a snack) we determined
		that we could have the master bedroom suite separated from the
		rest of the house. To get to his bedroom, or back to the main house
		from his bedroom, Mr. Jillette walks seventy-five feet outside
		along a catwalk overlooking the courtyard.
		<p>
		When we realized the success of that portion of the design we
		continued it by having his office also separate. (Eventually we
		joined the office and master suite with the [Vintage Nude Studio]
		addition,  but originally his office was reached by a set of steel
		stairs up from the catwalk.)
		<p>
		In the following projects it is easy to lose sight of the original
		Slammer, but it did have:
		<p>
		<ul>
			<li>	A koi pond in the shape of a Goldfish cracker.
			<li>	A fire pole from the catwalk down into the courtyard. This
					was used once during a wedding ceremony held at the Slammer
					(the groom entered on it).
			<li>	Structural fins holding up the catwalk which light up from
					the inside, glowing yellow and red at night.
			<li>	An entry to the courtyard between the office tower and the
					master bedroom tower. This was controlled by a rolling chain
					link gate and it felt like entering the yard of a prison, with a bit of
					a surprise once you were in the courtyard.
			<li>	A band room, for playing rock'n'roll, hidden behind the
					fourteen foor diagonal projection screen in the home theater.
			<li>	Half a dozen secret rooms including one called The
					Obvious Room which could be shown off to television crews
					touring the house.
			<li>	A coroner's victim outline of Teller in the kitchen, with his
					hand holding a knife. This was cut into the linoleum floor and
					was matched by an apparent line of blood from the shower in
					the master bathroom.
