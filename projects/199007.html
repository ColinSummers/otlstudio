	<p>
	For a school teacher and doctor from Brooklyn, New York their house in rural
	Pennsylvania had everything but a decent place to spend a warm summer evening.
	Bugs usually drove them inside, even when it was light enough and warm enough
	to have dinner outdoors. Their barbecue deck area was a little too cramped to
	have the cook and guests milling around on and they needed more access to the
	field that dropped off from the house towards the woods.
	<p>	
	Our design added to the deck area and allowed for a set of steps down to the
	lawn. There was a linear area set against the latest addition to the house, and
	it reinforced an axis that we introduced with the sun porch, a screened room
	with a gable roof. The floor of the sun room was tongue-and-groove red fir,
	which was oiled and lightly sanded.
