	<p>
	Sited on a flat two acre lot in Beverly Hills Post Office, the existing
	house was two thousand square feet. The roof structure was
	interesting, but the plan was a mess: there had been too many
	renovations of a plan which was probably not clear enough to
	begin with.
	<p>
	We ran the exterior siding into the interior, creating a series of
	clearly identifiable volumes which the circulation and public spaces
	slid between.
	<p>
	A number of iterations, present to the client in computer
	renderings and drawings, saw us scale the design back from a
	complete gutting and second story to a more sensitive re-skinning
	and re-use of most of the spaces. The final design showed real
	promise as a minimalist essay on a family residence. The clear
	definition of the northern bar of private spaces was legible
	throughout, and certainly was not in the original house.
	<p>
	Ultimately the house, for a television actress and her novelist
	husband, was not built. The couple sold the lot and moved to a
	more modest location in the Valley.
