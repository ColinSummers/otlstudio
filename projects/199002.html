	<p>
	Two biology professors at New York University planned to retire to Alabama, to
	an eighty acre, wooded lot. The wanted a house which would be spacious enough
	for a full herpetology laboratory and the usual compliment of guest room,
	library, and living spaces. At the last meeting the house was seventy-five
	hundred square feet and a single story, organized around a courtyard, the
	fourth wall of which was the forest.
	<p>
	The construction of the house is not typical. It is post-and-beam with
	non-bearing panels as infill. There are very few interior finishes, with
	the roof planks and sheathing exposed inside. This rough, unfinished look is
	appropriate for this outdoor-oriented couple, and it allowed a much larger
	home to be built at a considerably lower price.
