	<p>
	At the end of 2002 the Penn & Teller show moved into Las Vegas in
	a more permanent fashion and as they started to curtail their
	constant touring Mr. Jillette began to reconsider some portions of
	<a href="199601.html">the home we had designed for him</a>,
	especially those which we had cut for budget considerations the
	first time around.
	<p>
	The first of these projects was a recording studio (ground floor)
	and sitting room (second floor). We already had a full band room
	connected to the home theater. The acoustics were so good in this
	space that one of the noted jazz bands in Las Vegas recorded their
	album there
	(<a href=http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/6307051655>&ldquo;Four Nights at The Slammer,&rdquo;</a>).
	Mr. Jillette now wanted to have a proper mixing space. We had
	also made the master bedroom as small as possible; a decade
	later with the owner sleeping there every night, this made less
	sense. The new plan included a sitting room connected to the
	master bedroom.
	<p>
	There was a  space for the complex addition between the master
	suite tower and the tower containing Mr. Jillette&rsquo;s office.
	This was, in fact, a space that was purposefully designed void, a
	place where the tension between the two parts of the house were
	allowed to resolve in space rather than in a solid piece. Inserting a
	new volume was going to be challenging.
	<p>
	The project followed our usual process. We defined and refined
	the program of spaces so that we knew exactly what we were
	trying to fit into the space. The decision was made to allow the
	addition to project from the east faade, and the east wall of it
	would tilt, in an inverse to the tilted wall of the kitchen. Because we
	would be filling in the entry to the courtyard, we would eventually
	need to develop a new entry to the house.
	<p>
	We created a scale model (one inch to four feet) to show the client.
	With the general idea accepted we moved to much more detailed
	drawings and renderings. The renderings meant that we were able
	to test out views from the entry to the new sitting room, which were
	then approved by the client.
	<p>
	The new two story structure is a manipulation of the existing
	geometries (a series of slight rotations in plan), and a tight essay of
	exterior space relating to interior space. The resulting tension of
	definition and envelope is expressed with storefront stretched
	between the exposed concrete block wall and a wall that continues
	out the terrace.
	<p>
	Our intention to create a continuous space from interior to exterior
	was realized with a walnut floor with narrow strips of maple.
	These lines transform at the glass wall where the thin pieces of
	maple match the space between the teak planks; the dark and light
	patterns reverse.
	<p>
	A strip of glass over the entry to Mr. Jillette&rsquo;s office means
	that his office retains the island-like isolation that he appreciated
	in the original plan. The natural light still falls through the glass
	panel in the door which is reached by walking up a half flight of
	stairs from the sitting room. These stairs are curved, and are
	hidden behind a low wall, further increasing the privacy and
	separate quality to his office.
	<p>
	The studio addition started construction in October 2003 and was
	completed in June 2004. Crisci Custom Builders was the
	contractor.
