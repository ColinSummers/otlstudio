	<p>
	Jason Hackett, a printer from Hoboken, New Jersey, bought a
	large farmhouse in Thompson, Pennsylvania. For two years he
	worked on minor renovations to fix many of the small problems
	the building had. When he was referred to us he was considering
	some major changes to the existing structure. Our design for him
	involved opening the southeast corner of the building, and peeling
	the roof back, allowing a new, two story space within the old shell
	of the farmhouse to be flooded with light.
	<p>
	It was an opportunity for us to attach a more modern, open space to the
	very traditional, tightly defined spaces of the original farmhouse. We
	were also able to introduce a forty-five degree rotation to the primary
	orientation of the house. This oblique angle was on the site since
	arrival at the house was along a road that aimed directly at the corner
	of the new space.
	<p>
	We eroded this important corner, replacing the clapboards with a corner
	window: a double layer of true bent-glass that from the interior defied
	the logic of box construction, which dictates that the corners carry
	the loads of the roof and ceiling.
	<p>
	We removed the brittle asbestos siding and replaced it with warm cedar
	clapboards. By the time we were done, we had supplanted the feeling
	that the southern portion of the house was the addition. Instead, the
	drama of the entry off-axis into this vaulted space, filled with light,
	made the original farmhouse spaces seem like support for the new
	gathering hall.
	<p>
	(Because we brought the old addition down to the sill plates and
	foundation we were able to position all of the new windows freely. This
	meant that we were able to frame particular views of the site and the
	trees in those views.)
