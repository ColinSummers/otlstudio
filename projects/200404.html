	<p>
	In 2004 it was clear that it was time to add a family wing to 
	<a href="199601.html">The Slammer</a>. 
	<p>
	The general idea was to allow the new wing to be the south 
	wall of the courtyard. A new, even more private portion of the
	courtyard would have a ramp up to the main level of the new wing.
	Because there would be children bedrooms in this wing it was 
	important that they be close to the master bedroom. They are,
	in fact, linked to the master suite through the master dressing room, 
	but they are also just a few steps down the exterior catwalk. 
	<p>
	The entire addition is kept behind a screen of white clapboards, 
	a material that references domestic scale architecture and the 
	New England of Mr. Jillette's youth. 
	<p>
	The set of small boxes, which slide along one another as the master
	suite meanders south, continue south to be two more bedrooms 
	and a jack-n-jill bathroom. There is a large entertaining salon on the 
	same level which leads to a small office. (The office has a large
	window that faces north and looks along the axis of the lap pool.)
	<p>
	Downstairs there is a playroom that has a snack area at one end. This 
	space looks south into the desert through a wall of storefront glass. Also
	on the ground level is a room for a nanny and a powder room for playdates.
	<p>
	Construction started in June of 2005 and was substantially completed in
	November 2006.
