	<p>
	A weekend and summer home in the green mountains of Vermont needed
	an addition that would house a garage below and a studio above. The
	structure was originally a carriage house and the renovation to
	residential spaces was done extremely sensitively. There is a large
	two story space facing Equinox Mountain, with this stunning view to
	the north captured by two stories of glass.
	<p>
	We presented a rough sketch for placement of a new structure
	adjacent (but not yet connected) to the original house. There are
	considerable renovation issues on the main house, and if the two
	are kept separate during that work the cost will be lower.
	<p>
	We mimicked the large opening to the north, perfect for the
	painting studio, and also continued the line of small square
	windows which were original to the horse stalls in the carriage
	house. We tried to maintain the simple dignity of the agriculture
	buildings common to the area.
