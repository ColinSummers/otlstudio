	<p>
	After a number of visits to Joshua Tree National Monument (hiking,
	bird watching, rock scrambling, and picnics in the desert) the
	clients decided to buy some land and build a weekend house. The
	site was a desolate seventy-five acres just north and east of the
	city limits of Twenty-nine Palms.
	<p>
	The program for the building was simple: a pleasant retreat for a
	family and possible guests. We worked within a tight budget and
	listened closely to our structural engineer. We kept the forms
	simple, but carefully adjusted their position on the site to respond
	to the views and the arc of the sun in the wide desert sky.
	<p>
	The main volume of the house is a two story space with all of the
	public spaces in a single open rectangle. Looking down into this
	space is a catwalk which runs along a set of bookshelves. This is
	an arrangement of spaces, and a reminder of experiences, from
	the client's summer home experiences growing up, where there
	were  overlooks into the dining room and a large collection of
	books.
	<p>
	The guest house (a single room with a bath), a writing room (the
	client is a writer from Los Angeles), and the main house are all
	separate volumes. Arranging these volumes on a manipulated
	square building pad created a pool area, a sort of blind two-sided
	courtyard, and an entry step to the house. A number of the
	exterior spaces are without corners, and are defined by the
	tenuous edge-to-edge relationship of different volumes.
	<p>
	The construction documents were completed in February 2005
	and went out to contractors in the Yucca Valley area. Unfortunately, 
	due to the building boom in the Palm Springs and Desert Hot Springs 
	area, none of the local contractors were interested in the project.
