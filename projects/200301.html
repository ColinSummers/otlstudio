	<p>
	The clients' purchased a large house in Encino sited at the end
	of a ridge. It was a great house on a great site, but poorly
	constructed. Over a year of construction kept uncovering more
	and more problems with how the original house was constructed.
	<p>
	The design work was interesting, although a lot of it was small
	scale fixes to the original house. Although it was presented as
	a French chateau, the interior spaces often lacked the sort of
	formal definition that style would suggest. This lent an
	unresolved feeling to a lot of the rooms, and moving between
	them was not satisfying.
	<p>
	The worst of them was the main space, because it was a huge barn
	of a space with a balcony dividing the Entry from the Living
	Room but without real separation between the two. By redesigning
	the balcony to have a solid rail and the stair to have the same,
	and by dropping the ceiling over the balcony, we more carefully
	defined the two spaces.
	<p>
	We termed these fixes <em>syntactic corrections</em> and we
	probably did little more than a dozen of them in all, through a
	house that was nearly ten thousand square feet. The end result
	was that the house is much more cohesive. There were a lot of
	strange design decisions in the original design. There were two
	powder rooms and one of them had the door in the main entry
	space, when it was very easy to have it around the corner in the
	hallway instead. (Where it was just as easy to find, but it was
	more difficult to wind up looking into a toilet space when you
	first walk into the house.)
	<p>
	The work too much longer than expected, and was obviously more
	expensive than we had originally planned. (All of the flashing
	around the chimnies and parapet walls was done incorrectly. The
	decking on the terrace was lapped in the wrong direction and so
	forth.) The end result
	was stunning.
