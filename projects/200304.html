	<p>          
	The client, a production coordinator for a variety television show,
	had purchased seventy-five acres in a remote portion of South
	Dakota. She had camped on the land a few times. She wanted to build
	a large log cabin home. She had contacted several log cabin home
	manufacturers and one of them had gone through several plan
	revisions with her. In the end, she was dissatisfied with the plans
	that she was left with, and brought a halt to the process with the
	company and had a meeting with us.
	<p>
	It was a difficult proposition. She had an extremely specific plan
	in mind, but it didn't work well for the site or for the spaces she
	wished to place within it. Right from the start we explained that
	the log cabin portion was an envelope and that we could work within
	it, generating more modern spaces that took advantage of the
	spanning structure of the cabin construction. Some of these can be
	seen in the rough computer model we used to generate drawings for
	the client's review.
	<p>
	We were never given specific information about the site and in the
	final weeks of the project it was revealed that the slope ran the
	other direction. When we suggested that perhaps the orientation of
	the house be reconsidered we were dismissed from the project. (This
	was the only time we were ever dismissed.)
