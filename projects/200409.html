	<p>
	Once the entry to the courtyard at
	<a href="199601.html">The Slammer</a>
	was blocked by  
	<a href="200401.html">the new recording studio</a>,
	it was necessary to re-examine the problem of entering the house. 
	The occupants entered through the garage and into the courtyard. 
	That still worked, but visitors were a little disoriented. 
	<p>
	There was also a question of privacy in the main room of the 
	original A-frame, since there was a double story window in direct
	view of the road. 
	<p>
	We created a poured-in-place concrete terrace, sheilded from the
	road by a screen wall of split-faced concrete block. The concrete is
	stamped with a pattern of wooden planks, in reference to the old wooden
	porch that was part of the A-frame when it was first built, and a reference 
	to the absurdity of have a terrace built <em>so</em> much more
	solidly than the original house.
