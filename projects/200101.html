	<p>
	Our most ambitious residential project to date, the Castle is
	fifteen thousand square feet. It required extensive development
	of a ten acre lot which is twenty minutes south of the Las Vegas
	Strip. The client is a headline entertainer on The Strip. He was
	not able to find a home in a gated community which fit his
	personality. He toured
	<a href="199601.html">The Slammer</a>,
	the residence which we designed for Penn Jillette, and engaged
	our studio after an initial meeting.

	Through a three year process, as we crept towards the grading
	permit and the day we could finally start working on the access
	road to the site, the client was kept up-to-date on every step.
	We delivered a model of the project (one inch equals eight feet)
	which helped to maintain the client&rsquo;s enthusiasm for the
	project during the lengthy permit and site preparation phases.
	<p>
	Although the client wanted a Castle, he knew that we are not set
	dressers or theme-park architects (Las Vegas has plenty of both).
	So it is a modern building of stark cubic volumes arranged around
	the top of the irregular building pad at the top of the eighty-foot
	high hill. The volumes create a landscaped courtyard, and rise at
	right angles to the fall lines of the various slopes. This is similar to
	the way traditional crusades castles were sited on their
	commanding hilltops. 
	<p>
	In this residence, the individual groupings of volumes represent
	distinct parts of the program: public spaces, private spaces and
	a guest wing. The separation of these functions means that the
	house can be cooled (or heated) only as needed. The client is
	able to stay mostly in the master suite, which has all of the
	functions that his daily life requires. The forms tell a tale of
	occupancy and availability.

	The exterior of the Castle is black split-faced concrete block. This
	matches the hillside, which is covered with fist-sized, black, volcanic
	rocks and nothing but the scrubbiest desert vegetation. It will be
	imposing from below, increasing the security for its celebrity
	occupant.
	<p>
	The Castle broke ground in September 2003. The client moved into the 
	Master Suite in December 2006. There is still landscaping and other 
	portions of the project that need to be completed.
