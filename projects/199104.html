	<p>
	The Yonkes, a family from Brooklyn, bought fifty acres in a fairly
	remote section of Susquehanna County. They decided on a site for
	their house, had a foundation excavated and poured, and built
	the cinder block walls of the cellar. At that point they were
	discouraged by the daunting task of designing a house to sit atop
	their foundation, and simply capped the cellar space. They spent
	weekends in it, in large communal bedrooms and a living space,
	for three years before they were referred to us by a local realtor.
	<p>
	The Yonkes, the parents and their four adult children, wished to
	do the construction themselves. They hired us to design the house
	(in part to settle disagreements) and to oversee the construction.
	We were constrained by the existing foundation, but we brought in 
	some new ideas like in-floor heating and cement roof tiles.
	<p>
	This was by far the largest project we had worked on to date, but
	it had the least freedom. We were faced with very strict parameters
	of symmetry and window size. Much of the t-shaped plan had been
	laid out before we were involved. It still was a tremendous
	structure to draw and watch climb into the sky. The family was
	thrilled that we mediated the various disagreements so well and in
	the end their weekend home was even more grand than they had hoped.
