	<p>
	After we had completed the design for 
	<a href="199001.html">the general premises</a>
	for Hayden, Perle, and Silber we were retained to design, and
	realize, an office interior for one of the partners. Mr. Silber
	wanted to be set apart from the rest of the firm, he was, after
	all, the one attorney who had held an office in Manhattan. His
	clients would need to see him as a lone gun, not simply another
	soldier in an army of lawyers.
	<p>
	This separate image was created with the one surface available for
	maximum modification: the ceiling. Since the Hudson River was
	directly outside the office window, the motion of the water, or the
	concept of the water's motion, was brought into the office and
	arrested in a wave of cedar planks. The warm glow of the cedar
	balanced the cold, gray light of the river (which was further muted
	by the tinted glass). The lights over Mr. Silber's desk were
	suspended on a track which hung through these cedar planks,
	allowing the ceiling a further disassociation from the furniture
	arrangement and other trappings of the ground plane.
	<p>
	Since the office was on the second floor of the converted ferry
	terminal (a steel-frame building) the design was able to take
	advantage of the high ceiling. The sheetrock followed the steel roof
	overhead as closely as possible, giving Mr. Silber's office the
	highest clearance, with twelve feet at one end. The cedar brought
	the perceived ceiling lower, but not quite as low as the dropped,
	acoustical panel ceilings found in the rest of the offices.
	<p>
	Mr. Silber was ecstatic, wildly pleased with the results of the design
	and carpentry. His office received nothing but compliments.
