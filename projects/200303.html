	<p>          
	A film director and his wife, a production designer, had a small
	1920s bungalow in Venice, CA. It was just south of the Santa
	Monica airport, which is a busy general aviation airport. They
	were considering expanding their family and had really outgrown
	the original spaces in the house (they already had turned the
	garage into a studio and work space). Part of the problem was
	how to isolate the living spaces from the sound of the air traffic
	overhead without giving up the connection to the outdoors, which
	is so key to the experience of Southern California.
	<p>		
	It was exciting working for two creative people because they really
	understood how we might create drama in the original spaces
	with the addition of some less traditional ones.
