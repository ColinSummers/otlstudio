	<p>
	The law offices for this firm of three partners and three associates were to
	move from Hoboken and New York to a single location on a renovated pier on the
	Hudson River. The pier was converted from an abandoned ferry terminal to raw
	commercial space by the Hartz Development Corporation, which also was building
	the Riva Pointe Condominium development one pier south. They offered Hayden,
	Perle and Silber free architectural services with the signing of the lease, but
	their preliminary plan was so far from what the firm wanted they hired
	Whitehead & Co. (just formed and not yet incorporated) freshly out of school.
	<p>
	The design for the four thousand square feet had to reflect the individual
	personalities whic made up the firm (it was, in fact, a partnership of
	professional corporations, rather than individuals), and at the same time
	impress prospective clients with the unified, coherent image of a boutique law
	firm. The offices for the six lawyers were set along the south window wall in a
	saw- toothed arrangement. This gave each office its own identity when they were
	viewed from the large, open, secretarial area.
	<p>
	A client approaching the office was brought into the central work area
	visually, but waited in a comfortable area separate from it. The reception area
	and the main conference room were on the major axis of the space, both with
	views into the work area. The law library and the support spaces (copy room,
	minor conference room, and law library) were grouped along the north wall. A
	client would walk in a controlled circulation zone that fit between this
	support zone and the central work area, so they were shielded from the chaos of
	a working office.
	<p>
	The clients were pleased with the design, the senior partner of the firm,
	Joseph Hayden said at the final meeting, "Your creativity has made our lives
	better." For our first commercial and only project that was a mark of a resounding 
	success.
	<p>
	(In 2004 the firm was dissolved and the next tenant gutted the space.)
