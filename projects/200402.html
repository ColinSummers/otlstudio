	<p>
	The Murrietas lived in a small 1920s Spanish-style home in
	Larchmont, a quiet neighborhood of Los Angeles. Although they
	needed more room (they were due to have a second child as we
	started the design process), they didn't want to leave their
	family-oriented neighborhood, with its sidewalks crowded with
	strollers and kids skateboarding down the center of the streets.
	<p>
	We first supervised a renovation of the two spaces at the front of
	the structure, which were the best examples of 1920s spaces in the
	house: a vaulted living room space and a dining room with a
	paneled wood ceiling.
	<p>
	Then we designed a second floor which contained a similar
	vaulted space for the master bedroom and a flat-ceiling section for
	a master bathroom, office and den. The arrangement of the spaces
	was a duplicate of the vaulted and flat-ceilinged spaces below,
	just flipped in plan.
	<p>
	The stair tower which connected the new second floor to the old is
	a more modern element, reflecting the sensibilities of the clients,
	who were not interested only in the traditional aspects of their
	home but also the possibilities of juxtaposing something more
	contemporary.
	<p>
	It was a welcome opportunity to work at a smaller scale, where
	we were able to design the pattern in the linoleum in the
	kitchen and the precise method of attachment for the trellis
	members over the new terrace.
	<p>
	It started construction in October 2003 and was completed in July
	2004. Behr Construction was the contractor.
