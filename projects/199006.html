	<p>
	A month after our 
	
	we were hired for another. The Savins, a family from Philadelphia,
	wanted to add a screened porch for summer evenings, to their
	existing weekend home. They expressed their concerns that the
	space would be useless during the winter months, when they
	came up to ski. Our design had screened panels,
	tongue-and-grooved, that could be removed in the winter
	months.
	<p>
	These smaller jobs were crucial to our understanding of details, and
	how we would turn drawings into a built project. Fitting things
	together with our own hands taught us about the materials and the
	methods for putting them together. For good design there is no better
	teacher than actual construction experience.
