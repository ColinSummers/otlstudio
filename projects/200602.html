	The clients acquired the house in the lot adjacent to their
	home. This was a protective measure, to keep a developer from
	purchasing it and building something which would destroy their
	own second story views of the Malibu shoreline.

	The program was to renovate the 1940s house, updating the
	surfaces and using whatever minimal changes we could to make it
	a desirable rental property. The clients agreed to have all of
	the responsible work done: a new heating and ventilation system,
	new electrical wiring, all new copper plumbing, and a new
	hardwood floor. It had been a long time since any portion of the 
	home had been upgraded or even maintained well.
	<p>
	To keep costs to a minimum we didn't cut any new openings in
	exterior or interior walls, and we didn't make any changes that
	required structural calculations. Even though the Master
	Bathroom is dramatically different, the plumbing for the
	fixtures are in primarily the space locations.
	<p>
	Studying the plan we realized that there was an old connection
	between the Dining Room in the front of the house and the small
	Family Room which opened to the back yard. We opened the wall,
	added French doors, and now the space flows all the way from the
	street to the rear of the lot. (The French doors between the
	Dining Room and the Family Room are frosted, and there are
	curtains to the front yard, so privacy can be maintained.)

	We changed the entry into the Kitchen, so that we could make the
	old, tiny entry into a Laundry Room. We altered the smaller
	bathroom so that there is a single entrance instead of two, and
	so that there is a real door (it had an accordion door into the
	Den).
	<p>
	We designed a deck for the south west corner of the house, off
	of the Kitchen. The details are an evolution of the railing we
	designed for the
	<a href="200203.html">Canyon Deck</a>.
