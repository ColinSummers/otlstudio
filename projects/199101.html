	<p>
	Paul Kahn and Cathy Iino, residents of New Haven, Connecticut,
	bought a cottage in Rhode Island. It was a little cramped for their
	small family (two daughters), especially if they invited along any
	guests for the weekend. We were hired to design an addition and
	renovation to add a master bedroom, a children's bedroom, and a
	full bath. Our design incorporated a screened dining area and new
	family room, and enlarged the existing kitchen.
	<p>		
	Although the clients were not adverse to adding substantial square
	footage to the residence, they wanted to retain the cottage feel of
	the house. Most importantly, they didn't want something that was
	recognizably contemporary in design. This was what moved us to
	hide the second floor behind the continuation of the existing roof
	angle, so that it was revealed from the street as only two small
	balconys recessed into the slope of shingles. Context and
	continuity became important factors in our design, which the
	clients say is very successful.
