	<p>
	Officially, Whitehead & Co. had not yet been formed, but this was
	the first project that the two partners collaborated on. The Darrows
	wanted a weekend house on a small lake in rural Pennsylvania.
	They hired Joel Whitehead, Robert's father, to build the house, and
	Colin and Robert designed it.
	<p>
	The house is two floors, thirty feet square, and is set into a hillside,
	which slopes towards the water. The lower floor has a garage-like
	space for a boat trailer and a family room. The facade which faces
	the lake is two stories high and almost entirely sliding doors and
	large windows. Keeping the upper floor fairly open, for typical
	weekend parties, and having the view of the lake visible even from
	the front door, were the most important goals in this design.
	<p>
	Since we were still in school, we were anxious to employ some of
	the skills we were spending long hours in the studio acquiring. We
	set a strict zone of circulation alongside the center line of the plan,
	perpendicular to the shoreline, setting up an a-b rhthym of bays
	into which we worked the major and minor spaces. We also
	designated a thick "utility" zone which helped place kitchen and
	bath. The facade toward the road had just two small windows,
	which meant that we had an entry sequence from the closed face
	to the cars, through the house to look out through the large open
	face to the water.
	<p>
	The most important thing we leaned on the project is that within
	the small budget, small town constraints of residential design we
	still had a tremendous freedom to address the problems we saw in
	the communities around us: uninspired design, copy cat decoration
	and cookie cutter plans.
	<p>
	The Darrows were so comfortable with the design that they had no hesitation in
	selling the house they were living in and moving into the `weekend' house full
	time.
