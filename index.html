      After twenty years of designing together, we've taken a moment to
      make an online presence and a portfolio for potential clients to
      peruse. Up until now our marketing efforts consisted of the few
      business cards we would hand out; all of our projects arrive in our
      studio via word-of-mouth.
      </p>
      <p>
      We have designed
      <a href="code/index.html">web sites</a>,
      furniture, rooms, gardens, and
      assisted with architect-client interaction on houses (the
      studio includes an architect licensed in Pennsylvania and California). We
      have been involved in the design of several residences and a
      couple commercial projects in quite a few different states.
      The <a href="projects.html">Projects page</a> is a portfolio-in-progress.
      </p>
      <p>
      The <a href="mission.html">Mission page</a>
      will tell you what we are hoping to accomplish. We occasionally
      update the <a href="journal.html">Journal</a>
      with notes and photographs about recent projects, before they
      are added to the portfolio of projects.
      <a href="about.html">About</a> will tell you who we are and
      <a href="contact.html">Contact</a> will tell you how to get ahold of us.
