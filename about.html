      <strong>Outside The Lines Studio</strong> is a partnership. We started designing
      and building together in 1987, two years after we met at
      <a href="http://cornell.edu">Cornell University's</a>
      <a href="http://www.aap.cornell.edu">College of Architecture, Art and Planning</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
      Our first design company was called Whitehead &amp; Co. and we built a number of
      projects ourselves. For several years we followed separate paths and then
      reunited in Los Angeles, CA to start Outside The Lines Studio.

      <strong>Robert Whitehead</strong> was the valedictorian of Blue Ridge High
      School in north eastern Pennsylvania. He grew up building
      houses with his father, a contractor. After securing his
      bachelors of architecture from Cornell, and building
      residential projects for two years as one half of Whitehead &amp;
      Co. he worked for several traditional architecture firms. Just
      before returning to work with his first partner, he was
      employed at
      <a href="http://hillier.com/home">The Hillier Group</a>, the third largest architectural
      firm in the country. In August 2006 Robert was licensed as an architect in
      the state of Pennsylvania. He is a member of the
      <a href="http://aia.org">American Institute of Architects</a>.
