      Everyone we have built for, they have a dream of a house, but they
      don't know how to express it. Expressing that dream for them is
      the challenge we have found worth our commitment.

    We look at each design problem as an encapsulated set of
    constraints, and initially we are focused on exploring them.
    Primary among these is the site, which is difficult to change and
    unique to each project. The site will help dictate a
    <a href="mission/generating.html">generating geometry</a>.

      You employ stone, wood and concrete, and with these materials
      you build houses and palaces; that is construction. Ingenuity is at
      work. But suddenly you touch my heart, you do me good, I am
      happy and I say: &lsquo;This is beautiful.&rsquo; That is
      architecture. Art enters in.
      <span class="attribution">Le Corbusier 1927</span>
    </div>

    <p>
    That quote is probably on more architecture web sites and
    brochures than any other. It is the lofty goal of most practicing
    architects: reaching beyond merely satisfying their clients barest
    needs, and even expressed desires, and creating something
    expressive, something which carries and communicates some
    meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
    We have been fortunate that we have rarely been forced to
    accept commisions which didn't interest us. Mercenary work is
    mind-numbing. On the other hand, if the project is interesting it
    doesn't matter how difficult the work it, we never tire of it.
    </p>
    <p>
    The generating geometry, mentioned above, sometimes leads to a
    bit of <a href="mission/plan.html">plan fixation</a>.

      The career issues Steven Ehrlich has faced for nearly twenty
      years in Southern California are those that confront all
      architects of good faith and strong ambition &mdash; the
      anxiety of influence, the dilemma of synthesis, the search for
      identity, and the emergence of a voice.
      <span class="attribution">Joseph Giovannini 1998, Introduction to Steve Erlich's monograph</span>
    </div>

    <p>
    Yes. In spades: anxiety, dilemma, search and emergence. Although
    that last one seems to be a tiny scratching still, a still too-tentative
    reaching for something that <em>could</em> be; mostly we find
    ourselves pre-occupied with the first three.
